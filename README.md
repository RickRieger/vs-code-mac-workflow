# Some Expert-Level Mac/VSC Keyboard Shortcuts

### Managing Apps

- Command-Space to launch Spotlight.
- Command-Tab to switch apps.
- Click the green button in upper left corner of window to make a fullscreen workspace.
  - Or, better yet: Command+Ctrl+F to do the same.
- Three finger swipe left or right - Switch workspaces.
  - Or Ctrl+arrows, but they're awkward to reach.
- Three finger swipe up - get overview of windows and workspaces.
  - Or Ctrl+up arrow, but stillâ€¦ awkward to reach.
- Click-and-drag to move windows in and out of workspaces.
- Click-and-drag a window into an already filled workspace for split screen.
  - Then drag the line between them to resize.

### Text Editing "Movements"

- Left arrow and right arrow for moving one character at a time.
- up arrow and down arrow for moving one line at a time.
- Option with left arrow and right arrow to move one word at a time.
- CTRL-A and CTRL-E or command with left and right arrows to move to the start or end of a line. Or, alternately, function-left or right arrow (or home/end) will do the same.
- Command with up and down arrows to move to the top or bottom of the file.

### Text Editing "Actions"

- Shift to select - works with all movements above.
- Delete left (sometimes called backspace) and delete right (confusingly sometimes just called delete, usually activated via fn+delete or fn+backspace) - works with option and command to delete word-left or word-right or line-left or line-right.
